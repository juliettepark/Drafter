# Drafter - Full Stack React App
## Welcome
Join or create your own drafts to fairly split drafting options among several drafters.

For instance, to fairly split 5 different candy bars between 2 people, Drafter will allow
both users to pick 1 candy bar each per round (Ex. Dave picks Snickers then Ronald picks Almond Joy).
Rounds may continue until candy bars are evenly
divided between the users.

## Demo!

## Features
1. Create new draft - customize Drafters, rounds, draft options, and IDs!
2. Error checking - the application will verify sufficient options or rounds.
3. Join Draft - Drafts can be concurrently viewed so that multiple drafters may participate.
4. View Draft - Non-drafters may also view the current state of the draft in a view-only mode.
5. Turns - Refresh button to check if a selection has happened. Will automatically allow next-in-line drafter to pick!
6. Instructions - Separate page of instructions to guide confused users.

## Technologies Used: 
1. React and Typescript to implement custom Components
2. Node.js and Express.js to develop RESTful APIs 
3. Mocha.js for unit tests and comprehensive test suites of server-side functions
4. CSS to design and implement pleasant, animated UI
