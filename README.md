# Drafter - Full Stack React App
Join or create your own drafts to fairly split drafting options among several drafters.

For instance, to fairly split 5 different candy bars between 2 people, Drafter will allow
both users to pick 1 candy bar each per round (Ex. Dave picks Snickers then Ronald picks Almond Joy).
Rounds may continue until candy bars are evenly
divided between the users.

## Focuses: 
         1) Implementing custom Components
         2) Unit tests for server-side functions to ensure correctness
         3) Design and implement pleasant UI with CSS
         4) Event handlers and properly updating state
